# My Personal Project: Fitness Pals



This is a desktop application that will enhance motivation and become fit at the same time. The application allows the
to choose a fitness plan and alter the given plan based on the user's experience, needs, and goals. Everyday, there will
be a given goal for exercise, sleep, and nutrition. Every goal that is met each day, there is a feature that is added to
your pet's house, hence the name "Pals". In order to keep your pet happy and healthy, the goals must be met. 
This way, people can be stay fit and be motivated while also being able to track their progress in a fun and motivating
way.  

I am choosing this project because I like living a healthy lifestyle. However, it is very difficult at times because it 
is hard as seeing progress takes a long time. I wanted to find something that I could see physically getting better if I
hit my goal and this project combined my love for dogs and fitness. This way I can physically see that I am making
progress, keeping me motivated. This app is for people like me who want to stay motivated to be healthy but find it 
difficult as progress is hardly seen.



## Fitness

The fitness aspect of the app can contain many plans based on the user:

- Weight loss
- Healthy lifestyle choices
- Getting fit

These plans will be based on three aspects that will make up daily goals:

- Sleep
- Calorie and nutrient consumption
- Exercise and calorie burned


## Pals

How the pets aspect works is that once a goal is hit, there will be an added feature to the the user's pet's house.
Every goal that is not hit will not take away any features, but over time, the more goals not met, the sadder the pets
will become.

**Hitting goals but not actually doing it will keep the pets happy, but the user will be cheating themselves**
